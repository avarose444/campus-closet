# TOOLS USED
React: JavaScript UI library for building the frontend. 

Vite: development server used.

ESLint: Linting configuration (eslint.config.js) to enforce code quality/style. 

Node.js / npm: Project likely uses npm (package.json, package-lock.json) for dependency management. 

Firebase: backend for user authorization and data storage.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Standard web languages used.

# To initially build app structure
We ran a set of terminal commands that Ava used during an internship:

npm create vite@latest 

npm install

npm run dev

npm install firebase react-router-dom

npm install react-icons

# Acknowledgments 

Small portions of the debugging and implementation guidance for this project were assisted by ChatGPT (OpenAI). 
Specifically, ChatGPT was used for help with debugging React components, CSS scrolling behavior, and JS and HTML elements of the screens we implemented for demonstration purposes (add item and login).
